###[Case Study: Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis](/https://github.com/nora-marie-95/Instacart-Basket-Analysis-Project)

Instacart is an existing online grocery store that operates through an app. For this project, I analyzed purchasing behaviours and customer profiles.

Tools: Python and Jupyter, Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy

Procedures: Data wrangling, Combining data, Deriving new variables, Grouping data and aggregating variables
