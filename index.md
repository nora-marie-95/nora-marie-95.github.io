### [Case Study: Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis](https://github.com/nora-marie-95/Instacart-Basket-Analysis-Project)

Background: Instacart is an existing online grocery store that operates through an app. For this project, I analyzed purchasing behaviours and customer profiles.

Data: Open-sourced from Instacart. The final integrated date set has over 30 million rows and includes information about orders, Instacart's customers and products.

Tools: Python and Jupyter, Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy

Procedures: Data wrangling, Combining data, Deriving new variables, Grouping data and aggregating variables

Findings:
The weekday where the most orders are placed is Saturday. The time period with the highest number of purchases is between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
