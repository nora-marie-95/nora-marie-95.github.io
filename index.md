### [Case Study: Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis](/https://github.com/nora-marie-95/Instacart-Basket-Analysis-Project)

Instacart is an existing online grocery store that operates through an app. For this project, I analyzed purchasing behaviours and customer profiles.

Data: Open-sourced from Instacart. The final integrated date set has over 30 million rows and includes information about orders, Instacart's customers and products.

Tools: Python and Jupyter, Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy

Procedures: Data wrangling, Combining data, Deriving new variables, Grouping data and aggregating variables

The weekday where the most orders are placed is Saturday. The time period with the highest number of purchases is between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.

The most expensive products are purchased at 2 a.m. The departments with the most product orders are the produce, dairy eggs, snacks and beaverages department!
